### The Ultimate Meal Idea Generator

```
Create an app that helps me decide what to cook.

It should have the following features:

1.  **A text input field for "Available Ingredients":** This is where I'll list the ingredients I have in my kitchen.
2.  **A text input field for "Dietary Preferences":** Here, I can specify any dietary needs like "vegetarian," "gluten-free," or "low-carb."
3.  **A dropdown menu for "Complexity":** This should offer options like "Quick & Easy," "Intermediate," and "Feeling Ambitious."
4.  **A "Generate Meal Ideas" button.**
5.  **An output field for "Recipe Suggestions":** This will show a list of 3-5 meal ideas with creative names based on my inputs. For each suggestion, it should provide a brief, one-paragraph description of the dish and a simple list of high-level cooking steps.
6.  **An image generation widget called "Food Inspiration":** This should generate an appetizing image of the first meal suggestion.
```

### The Creative Story Starter

```
Create an app that generates creative story starters.

The app should have these widgets:

1.  **A dropdown menu for "Genre":** Include options like "Science Fiction," "Fantasy," "Mystery," "Horror," and "Comedy."
2.  **A text input for "A Character Trait":** Users can enter a single compelling character trait, for example, "a retired astronaut who collects antique maps" or "a chef who can taste emotions."
3.  **A text input for "A Specific Object":** Users can input a random object that must be central to the story, like "a cracked pocket watch," "a glowing mushroom," or "a key that doesn't fit any lock."
4.  **A "Generate Story Starter" button.**
5.  **An output field for "Your Story Opening":** This will generate a compelling opening paragraph for a story (approximately 150-200 words) that incorporates the selected genre, character trait, and object. The tone should be engaging and leave the reader wanting more.
6.  **A text generation widget for "Possible Titles":** This should suggest three creative and fitting titles for the story that is started.
